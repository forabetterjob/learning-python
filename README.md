# Learning Python

I've used Python a number of times already and I'm fairly familiar with it. However, I decided to take an online course and re-learn it from the beginning, just to cover any gaps that may exist in my knowledge, and brush up on a language that I haven't used in a while.

Anyway, this repo is just to move code easily between my different machines as I move around, so there's nothing exciting in here!
